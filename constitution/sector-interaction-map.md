# Sector Interaction Map

How the Grid's sectors communicate, depend on, and constrain each other. Use this for blast-radius reasoning before starting cross-repo work. The catalog DAG (`catalogs/relationships.json`) is authoritative for node-level dependencies; this document explains the *sector-level* picture.

## Core Sector — The Foundation

**Direction:** Everything depends on Core. Core depends on nothing inside the Grid.

Core Nodes provide contracts that all other sectors consume:

| Core Node | What other sectors consume |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Kernel** | `IGridContext`, `INodeContext`, `IOperationContext`, `IStartupHook`, `IHealthContributor`, `IAgentExecutionContext` — consumed by every live Node and all AI sector Nodes |
| **Transport** | `ITransportPublisher`, `ITransportConsumer`, `IMessageHandler` — consumed by Web.Rest, Data, and planned by Flow |
| **Vault** | `ISecretStore`, `IConfigProvider` — consumed by Auth; planned by AI (model API keys), Operator (cost controls) |
| **Auth** | `IAuthenticatedIdentityAccessor`, `IAuthorizationPolicy` — consumed by Web.Rest; planned by Capabilities, Operator |
| **Data** | `IRepository`, `IUnitOfWork`, `IOutboxStore` — planned by Memory, Knowledge, Flow, Operator |

**Blast radius rule:** Any breaking change in Kernel cascades to every other sector. Treat Kernel changes as Grid-wide events, not single-repo changes. Always run canary tests across all dependents before publishing.

---

## Ops Sector — The Nervous System

**Direction:** Ops depends on Core. Ops is consumed by everything else as a telemetry sink and notification channel, but Ops never calls back into its consumers.

```
Core ──────► Ops
             │
             ├─ Pulse: receives telemetry FROM all sectors
             ├─ Notify: sends notifications TO external channels (email, SMS)
             └─ Actions: provides CI/CD workflows TO all repos
```

**Key cross-sector rule:** The Ops ↔ AI boundary is precise:
- **Pulse owns the data pipeline.** It collects, routes, and stores telemetry. It does not reason about what the data means.
- **AI sector (specifically Operator) owns the meaning layer.** Operator reads Pulse data to make safety and oversight decisions. It never writes to Pulse.

**Blast radius rule:** Pulse changes affect every Node that emits telemetry (all of them). Actions changes affect every repo's CI pipeline. Scope these carefully and validate with nightly CI runs before rolling out.

---

## AI Sector — The Cognition Layer

**Direction:** AI sector depends heavily on Core. AI sector Nodes depend on each other in a specific graph.

```
Kernel ──────────────────────────────► Agents, AI, Memory, Knowledge,
                                        Evals, Capabilities, Flow, Operator, Sim
Vault ────────────────────────────────► AI (model API keys), Operator (cost controls)
Auth ─────────────────────────────────► Capabilities (tool permissioning), Operator
Data ─────────────────────────────────► Memory, Knowledge, Flow, Operator
Pulse ────────────────────────────────► AI (inference telemetry), Evals, Operator

AI (inference) ───────────────────────► Agents (model calls), Memory (embeddings),
                                         Knowledge (embeddings), Evals (model scoring)
Capabilities (tool registry) ─────────► Agents (IToolInvoker resolution)
Memory (storage) ─────────────────────► Agents (IAgentMemory), Knowledge (shared infra)
Flow (orchestration) ─────────────────► Agents (multi-step coordination)
Operator (oversight) ─────────────────► Agents, Flow (approval gates, circuit breakers)
```

**AI sector internal rule:** No AI Node calls another AI Node's implementation directly — only through contracts. The same contract-first pattern as Core applies here.

**Blast radius rule:** AI sector is currently all Seed phase — nothing is deployed. When the first AI Nodes launch, treat each new inter-AI dependency as a canary surface that needs explicit integration tests.

---

## Meta Sector — Self-Awareness

**Direction:** Meta depends on Core for tooling but does not have runtime dependencies. Architecture and Lore are read-only from all other sectors' perspective.

```
Architecture (this repo)
  ├─ Reads all sectors' catalogs, ADRs, repo context
  ├─ Provides routing, governance, and agent definitions
  └─ Does NOT receive signals from production at runtime

Lore (planned)
  ├─ Ingests from Architecture, ADRs, GitHub state
  ├─ Compiles living wiki for agents and developer
  └─ Read-only output (no writes back to source repos)

Studios
  ├─ Public website — reads release notes and site-sync packets
  └─ No runtime Grid dependencies
```

---

## HoneyHub — The Orchestration Brain (Proposed)

**Direction:** HoneyHub reads from Core, Ops, and AI sectors. It writes *task assignments* back to GitHub Issues (which then trigger Ops/CI workflows). It is not yet deployed.

When live, HoneyHub closes the loop:

```
Core runtime events (via Pulse/Ops)
  │
  ▼
HoneyHub Knowledge Graph
  │
  ├─ Interprets signals against Goals
  ├─ Adjusts plans
  └─ Issues task assignments (GitHub Issues → Codex)
       │
       ▼
     Target repo execution (Core, AI, Ops)
```

Until HoneyHub is live, the Architecture repo (Meta) serves as the manual planning surface. See ADR-0003.
